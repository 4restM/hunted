# Project Name #
  Hunted

## Heading ##
  A fun 2-player online game where players 'hunt' each other.

## Sub-Heading ##
  Gaming enthusiasts, casual gamers, and procrastinators will enjoy this game.

## Summary ##
  Hunted is a 2-Dimensional multiplayer game in which one player is a werewolf and another player is a human. The werewolf initially is the hunter and pursues the
  human, while the human tries to obtain silver for a weapon. Once the human has collected enough silver, they now have a weapon and can start hunting the werewolf.
  At this point, if the werewolf were to collide with the human, the werewolf player would lose. Thus, the hunter has become the hunted. However, the werewolf can
  obtain enough meat pieces to overpower the human. This would cause their roles of hunter/hunted to reverse again. The game continues like this, switching roles
  until one player is eliminated.

## Problem ##

  to find a cure. We have the cure.
